# Omarchy Waybar Rice

### My Arch Linux Waybar Rice
This is my ongoing and current setup for the waybar on Omarchy, meant to be paired with the zelda theme I've created for the OS in general. I think this makes it a bit cleaner and more minimalistic, and gives it a more personal feel than the typical linux boring grey bar.

**Installation** - 

> git clone https://github.com/TheFirstHero6/Omarchy-Waybar-Rice
> cd Omarchy-Waybare-Rice
> add to your waybar config path e.g. ~/.config/waybar

*Note*

Some of the styling in the preview image is from another CSS file, and meant to be coupled with my custom legend of zelda inspired theme, found at https://github.com/TheFirstHero6/Omarchy-Zelda-Theme-Dark
